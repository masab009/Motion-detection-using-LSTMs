# Motion-detection-using-LSTMs
Developed an AI model using LSTM networks to predict human activities from iPhone 6 sensor data. Processed accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MotionSense dataset to classify actions like walking, running, and sitting. Leveraged TensorFlow and Keras for implementation, achieving high accuracy in activity recognition.
