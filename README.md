# Motion-detection-using-LSTMs
Developed an AI model using LSTM networks to predict human activities from iPhone 6 sensor data. Processed accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MotionSense dataset to classify actions like walking, running, and sitting. Leveraged TensorFlow and Keras for implementation, achieving high accuracy in activity recognition.

The dataset, available on Kaggle here,
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malekzadeh/motionsense-dataset
includes accelerometer and gyroscope readings.

Key Features:

Advanced Sequential Models: Utilized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for activity classification.

Rich Sensor Data: Processed accelerometer and gyroscope data to capture detailed motion patterns.

High Accuracy: Achieved precise predictions for activities such as walking, running, sitting, and standing.

Technologies Used:

Machine Learning Frameworks: Implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.

Data Processing: Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data handling.

Visualization: Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn for data and performance visualization.
Project Highlights:

Feature Engineering: Extracted key features from raw sensor data.
Model Optimization: Tuned LSTM architecture and hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Results:
The LSTM model demonstrated high accuracy on both, train data and test data(98%), in classifying various activities, highlighting the effectiveness of sequential models in activity recognition. The code can be found on the following github repository:
